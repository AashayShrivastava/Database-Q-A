# Database-Q-A

A production-oriented Natural Language to SQL (NL-to-SQL) system built using LangChain, enabling users to query a MySQL database using plain English with contextual awareness and high accuracy.

This project leverages semantic memory, few-shot prompting, and vector embeddings to dynamically adapt SQL generation based on historical query patterns rather than static prompts.
